# Widget #

It does stuff and things!

## Description ##

No matter how many specs I write I always find trying to use a thing is a sure way of finding out what it's lacking and where it doesn't actually work. This app is the testbed for doing just that with two of my Gems: [Commandable][], the easiest way to add command line control to your Ruby apps, and [HashModel][] a hash based MVC model that makes searching and updating deeply nested hashes a breeze.

## Functionality ##

It makes widgets of course.

## Instructions ##

You can install it as a Gem by running:

    rake install

You can then run it by just typing:

    widget

Or run it as is by typing

    bin/widget <command> [parameter]

To see what it can do type
